This program is a 'pacman factory' in which simulated pacmen emerge from the top left of the webpage. Javascript animation creates the effect of bouncing and chomping.

# How to Run
Ensure the following files are on local machine: pacman.js, index.html, and png images. Drag and drop index.html into the browser to begin the program.

# Future improvements
This program could be improved my adding additional functionality to stop the movement of pacmen. User controls could be an interesting feature where key presses could influence pacmen movement.
